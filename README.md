# Overview

This program the beggining framework for a snakes and ladders game written in C++. The game can take up to 4 players and simple user interaction and text-based responses to implement a fun yet competitive environment.
I created this to demonstrate the basic concepts of C++ including: 
* variables
* expressions
* conditionals
* loops
* functions
* classes
* arrays

The program has 3 class files and one main file:
Player:
This class is responsible for handling player movement.

Snake:
This class is responsible for returning the head and tail of the snake.

Ladder:
This class is responsible for returning the bottom and top of the ladder.

Main:
This file takes the names of the users, create player, snake, and ladder objects, and runs the game loop.
